CREATE TABLE relational_rdf_data(sub varchar(200), prd varchar(200), obj varchar(200));

Our attempt to create a relational database from RDF data went through a few
iterations. In the end, we used the simplest and most exhaustive approach.
In C, a file is read line by line, tracking prefixes and storing them. Then,
depending on the ending delimeter of the previous line, the next line
is handled in specific ways. Whenever a prefix is found, the URI of that
prefix replaces the shorthand notation, and the entire string is saved into
a triple (defined in assignment3.h). This triple is used at the end of each
line to push the full URI's into the database, creating one table with
all values.
